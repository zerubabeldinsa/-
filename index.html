        <p>“The more you learn, the more you earn” - Warren Buffett</p>
        
        <p>The quote mentioned above, is one that resonates with my approach to professional development. As a mid-career business professional with a strong academic background in International affairs, I leverage the concept of “learning” as a valuable assets in the real word.</p>
        <p>I'm a passionate business professional with a proven track record of managing complex organizational projects and delivering successful results. One of the most important things I enjoy the most, is learning  from experience. I believe it makes me a better person on the job.</p>
        <p>That’s why I find delight in seeing a project from start to finish. Whether it’s leveraging expertise in defining key performance metrics or  transacting insights to actionable results, I take immense pleasure in "learning" everyday and achieving a desired outcome.</p>
